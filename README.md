Hi, I'm Madison!

I'm studying a Bachelor of IT @RMIT, with a special interest in Cyber Security.

My current units cover learning how to secure eCommerce, test vulnerabilities in web applications and going over the fundamentals of software development (agile, waterfall, etc).

I'm in the process of brushing up on languages such as HTML, CSS & PHP since I'm finding these particular skills to be valuable for supporting my team (and I realise that without practice, things fade!).

I recently adopted a cat named Oolong, who is just the most loving kitty on Earth - she is a black short hair, with a turqoise collar to match her eyes. :black_cat:


My pronouns are she/her, and I look forward to discovering the nooks and crannies of the great big field that is Information Technology âœ¨

Hello, World!

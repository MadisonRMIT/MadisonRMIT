Hi, I'm Madison!

I'm studying a Bachelor of IT @RMIT, with a special interest in Cyber Security.

My current units cover learning how to secure eCommerce, test vulnerabilities in web applications and going over the fundamentals of software development.

I'm in the process of brushing up on languages such as JavaScript and Python, since I'm finding these particular skills to be valuable for supporting my team (and I realise that without practice, things fade!).

My pronouns are she/her, and I look forward to discovering the nooks and crannies of the great big field that is Information Technology ✨
